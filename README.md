# tRPC Server Client Turborepo Template

ðŸš§ **This is a TEMPLATE** ðŸš§

A clean **template** designed to kickstart your project, sparing you the effort of configuring everything from scratch.

This is a straightforward monorepo that includes an Express tRPC server with Prisma ORM. The server interacts with a Next.js application and provides a wide range of features through tRPC.

With this template, you can quickly set up a powerful server-client architecture for your web application. The combination of Express, tRPC, Prisma and Next.js offers a seamless development experience and enables you to build robust and efficient applications with the ease of adding API documentation through OpenApi and SwaggerUI which comes integrated into this template.

Feel free to use this template as a starting point for your projects and customize it according to your specific requirements.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `apps/docs`: A simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that can be used to compare changes made to the `apps/web` application. It serves as a reference to understand the modifications.
- `apps/server`: This is a TypeScript Express [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) server with [swaggerUI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui). It provides the backend functionality for your application and handles API requests. `packages/trpc` is connected to the server and contains all the procedures.
- `apps/web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) Client which interacts with `api` package. It also incorporates [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
- `packages/trpc`: everything related to [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) including procedures and [trpc-openapi](https://github.com/jlalmes/trpc-openapi) exists in this package folder which is currently being used by `server`.
- `packages/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications. It includes reusable components and is styled using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- `packages/prisma`: A powerful database ORM that offers type safety and is utilized by the `trpc` package to enhance the developer experience.
- `packages/eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `packages/tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `packages/tailwind-config`: tailwind configuration which is used throughout the monorepo
- `packages/prettier-config`: This package includes the styling configuration for Prettier, ensuring consistent code formatting throughout the monorepo

### Project Setup

In the root directory, install dependencies by running.

```
cd trpc-server-client-turborepo-template
yarn
```

**Setting up .env file** - Copy .env.example file and rename it to .env in the root directory

#### Setting up Database

To configure the database for your project, you have two options:

1. If you have postgresql database ready, add the connection string to `DATABASE_URL`.

2. If you don't have a database and have Docker installed on your system, you can easily set it up using the following script command in your CLI:

```
yarn prisma db-up
```

Note : To check the environment details you can find the docker-compose file in `packages/prisma/docker-compose.yaml`

### Scripts

Scripts can be ran in the root directory by typing the following in cli.

- `yarn run dev` : Runs the entire monorepo.
- `yarn prisma studio` : Runs prisma studio from `package/prisma`
- `yarn prisma migrate` : Runs prisma database migrations from `package/prisma`
- `yarn prisma db-up` : Installs/Runs postgresql image from `package/prisma` in Docker.

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd trpc-server-client-turborepo-template
yarn
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd trpc-server-client-turborepo-template
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
